# Electromagnetic Waves
 Solvers for Maxwells Equations

## Summary

This experiment was meant to develop a modular and easy to use class and methods for doing vector calculus.  I later experimented with makeing the entire simulation environment itself a class, with its evolution routines enclosed as internal methods.  A "C++ inspired" implementation, this makes the files rather light, reduces the number of functions a user would need to memorize, and reduceds the ammount of code required to generate a rudimentary script.  The vector calculus routines included here are by no means exhaustive, but enough to solve Maxwell's equations in a vaccum, and are readily adaptable to other vector field type PDEs such as Navier-Stokes (if indeed one really wanted to spend all that CPU time on a Navier-Stokes experiment), or other vector valued systems like the Landau-Lifshitz Equations.
